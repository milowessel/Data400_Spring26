<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">My second idea for my mini project addresses the question: “Which performance, market, and roster factors best predict NBA team home attendance?” My project connects directly to economics because attendance represents consumer demand, and demand drives team revenue through ticket sales, concessions, and sponsorships. It also ties into my interest in sports business and front office decision-making, since attendance is one of the most important indicators of a franchise’s financial status.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="8" data-line-end="9">Data for my project is publicly available on websites such as Basketball Reference, ESPN, <a href="http://NBA.com">NBA.com</a>, which will serve as my main sources. Between these sites, I can scrape season-level team data including total home attendance and arena capacity, which can be used to calculate attendance as a percentage of capacity. Spotrac provides team payroll information, which shows organizational spending and investment in talent. In addition, I’m considering using publicly available economic data such as metro population and median income using sources like the U.S. Census Bureau or FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data), which will help capture the effect of local economic conditions on demand.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="10" data-line-end="11">To gather the dataset, I plan to use a combination of web scraping and manual downloading of tables where necessary. I will scrape team-season attendance, win percentage, and other performance variables from Basketball Reference for the years 2010 through the present, scrape payroll data from Spotrac for the same seasons, and merge these datasets by team and year. I also plan to include a measure of “star power” by collecting the number of All-Star selections per team per season, which is available through Basketball Reference’s All-Star rosters. Once merged, the final dataset will be structured at the team-season level, with one row per NBA team per season.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="12" data-line-end="13">The goal of my project is primarily predictive, using multiple linear regression to estimate how different business-relevant factors influence attendance demand. Multiple regression is well suited for this project because it allows me to isolate the effect of key predictors while controlling for others. For example, it can help determine whether team payroll still matters once win percentage is accounted for, or whether star power (All-Star count) has an independent effect beyond team performance. The dependent variable will be attendance percentage, and predictors will likely include win percentage, prior season win percentage, payroll, All-Star count, and prior season attendance, as well as economic indicators such as median income or city population.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="14" data-line-end="15">My project matters most to NBA front offices, ownership groups, and business operations departments, because accurate attendance prediction helps teams make better financial and strategic decisions. Attendance affects revenue forecasts, ticket pricing strategies, staffing needs, and marketing investments. Understanding the strongest predictors of attendance can help teams determine which aspects of the team, when invested in more, have the greatest affect on fan turnout. This research could also be valuable to sponsors and broadcasters, since attendance reflects fan engagement and overall market strength.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="16" data-line-end="17">On a broader scale, my project contributes to sports economics by helping explain how fans respond to changes in performance, payroll, and star power, and how demand differs across markets. If teams can better understand the drivers of attendance, they can allocate their resources more efficiently and make more informed business decisions.</p>
